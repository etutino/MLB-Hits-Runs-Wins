# MLB-Hits-Runs-Wins

I played softball for about 15 years and had a coach that always used to say:
* Whoever scores first wins the game; and
* Whoever has the most hits wins the game

I tested whether these assumptions were true with multiple years of MLB data. The analysis showed that comparing the two, whoever has the most hits wins the game occurred more frequently. I grouped this data based on wins due to having the highest number of hits by team to identify if there were differences by team. 

I also wanted to understand if there is a correlation between wins overall and winning due to having the most hits. In other words, are the teams that have more wins from having the most hits more likely to have more wins overall? I performed a bivariate analysis to determine the correlation between the two variables.

I used Kaggle with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). The Kaggle notebook can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/elizabethtutino/mlb-notebook-hits-runs-wins/edit/run/135168449
