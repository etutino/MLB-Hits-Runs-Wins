MLB Wins By Most Hits or Scoring First

I played softball for about 15 years and had a coach that always used to say:
* Whoever scores first wins the game; and
* Whoever has the most hits wins the game

So, are these both true? Is one more true than the other? I want to test these assumptions with multiple years of MLB data. 

When the assumption is identified that is more likely to be true (i.e., one situation occurred more frequently than the other), I want to group this data by team to identify if there are differences by team. 

I also want to understand if there is a correlation between wins overall and winning due to having the most hits or scoring first. In other words, are the teams that have more wins from having the most hits or scoring first more likely to have more wins overall?

I used Kaggle with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). The Kaggle notebook can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/elizabethtutino/mlb-notebook-hits-runs-wins/edit/run/135168449
